NAME
    RTIR-Extension-MISP - Integrate RTIR with MISP

DESCRIPTION
    MISP <https://www.misp-project.org/> is a platform for sharing threat
    intelligence among security teams, and this extension provides
    integration from "https://bestpractical.com/rtir" in RTIR.

RTIR VERSION
    Works with RTIR 5.0

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Patch RTIR for versions prior to 5.0.2
            patch -p1 -d /opt/rt5/local/plugins/RT-IR < patches/Add-callbacks-to-the-feed-listing-and-display-pages.patch

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RTIR::Extension::MISP');

    make initdb
        Only run this the first time you install this module.

        If you run this twice, you will end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

        If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions
        in case changes need to be made to your database.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
    Set the following in your RT_SiteConfig.pm with details for the MISP
    instance you want RTIR to integrate with.

        Set(%ExternalFeeds,
            'MISP' => [
                {   Name        => 'MISP',
                    URI         => 'https://mymisp.example.com',  # Change to your MISP
                    Description => 'My MISP Feed',
                    DaysToFetch => 5,  # For the feed page, how many days back to fetch
                    ApiKeyAuth  => 'API SECRET KEY',  # Change to your real key
                },
            ],
        );

DETAILS
    This integration adds several different ways to work between the MISP
    and RTIR systems as described below.

  Consume Feed from MISP
    After adding the MISP configuration described above, the Feeds page in
    RTIR at RTIR > Tools > External Feeds will have a new MISP option
    listed. This feed pulls in events for the past X number of days based on
    the DaysToFetch configuration. From the feed display page, you can click
    the "Create new ticket" button to create a ticket with information from
    the MISP event.

  MISP Portlet on Incident Display
    On the Incident Display page, if the custom field MISP Event ID has a
    value, a portlet MISP Event Details will be displayed, showing details
    pulled in from the event via the MISP REST API.

  Update MISP Event
    On an incident with a MISP Event ID, the Actions menu will have an
    option "Update MISP Event". If you select this action, RTIR will update
    the existing MISP event with an RTIR object, including data from the
    incident ticket.

  Create MISP Event
    If MISP Event ID has no value, the Actions menu on incidents shows an
    option to "Create MISP Event". Select this to create an event in MISP
    with details from the incident ticket.
